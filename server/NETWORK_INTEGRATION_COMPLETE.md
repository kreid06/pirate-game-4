### **Week 3-4 Integration Points**
```c
// Network packet processing with Week 3-4 validation
int network_process_incoming(struct NetworkManager* net_mgr, struct Sim* sim) {
    // Input validation with anti-cheat
    input_validation_result_t result = input_validation_validate(
        &input_validator, player_id, &input, current_time);
    
    if (result.valid) {
        // Process validated input through simulation
        simulation_process_player_input(sim, player_id, &input);
        
        // Store state for rewind buffer
        rewind_buffer_store(&rewind_buffer, current_tick, &sim_state);
    }
}

// Hit validation with lag compensation  
bool validate_shot(entity_id shooter_id, rewind_vec2_t shot_pos, uint32_t client_tick) {
    return rewind_buffer_validate_hit(&rewind_buffer, shooter_id, client_tick,
                                     shot_pos, shot_direction, shot_range);
}
```
