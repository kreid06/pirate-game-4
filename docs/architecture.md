# Architecture Overview

## Client/Server Separation

### Client Responsibilities
- **Input Handling**: Capture and process user input
- **Rendering**: Draw game state to canvas/WebGL
- **Prediction**: Apply input immediately for responsiveness
- **Interpolation**: Smooth movement between server updates
- **UI/UX**: Menus, HUD, game interface

### Server Responsibilities  
- **Physics Simulation**: Authoritative physics calculations
- **Game Logic**: Rules enforcement and state management
- **Collision Detection**: Ship-to-ship and environmental collisions
- **Player Management**: Connection handling and authentication
- **Anti-cheat**: Input validation and state verification

## Communication Flow

```
Client Input → Prediction → Send to Server
                   ↓
Server Receives → Validates → Updates State → Broadcast
                   ↓
Client Receives ← State Update ← Server Authority
       ↓
Reconciliation (Client adjusts prediction if needed)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Client Performance
- 60 FPS rendering target
- Efficient canvas/WebGL drawing
- Input lag minimization through prediction
- Memory management for long sessions

### Server Performance  
- 60 Hz physics simulation
- Efficient memory allocation in C
- Minimal garbage collection impact
- Scalable to 100+ concurrent players

## Technology Choices

### Why C for Server?
- **Performance**: Direct memory management and CPU efficiency
- **Stability**: Mature ecosystem for network servers
- **Resource Usage**: Lower memory footprint vs interpreted languages
- **Deployment**: Easy containerization and Linux deployment

### Why TypeScript for Client?
- **Web Platform**: Natural fit for browser deployment
- **Development Speed**: Rich tooling and hot reload
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Ecosystem**: Excellent libraries for game development

## Scalability Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
- Multiple server instances behind load balancer
- Room/match-based player distribution
- Shared state through Redis or similar

### Vertical Scaling
- Multi-threading for network I/O
- SIMD optimizations for physics
- Memory pooling for reduced allocations
